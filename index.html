        <h2 class="title">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h2>

        <p class="distance">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completely the course, I've succesfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

        <h2 class="title3">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
        <p class="distance">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can helpme learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staf did not disappoint. They werw very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outsanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% % recommend!"</p>

        <p class="distance2">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress wich I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
